Monster database construction.


For example, suppose you noticed that vampires don't have reflections

`Despite their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. <http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/vampire.htm>`_
`Looking at the creature's image (such as in a mirror) does not subject the viewer to a gaze attack. <http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#gazeAttacks>`_

.. code-block:: bash

  sqlite> select dnd_monster.name,dnd_special_ability.name from dnd_monster inner join dnd_monstertype on dnd_monster.type_id=dnd_monstertype.id inner join monster_special_ability on dnd_monster.id=monster_id inner join dnd_special_ability on dnd_special_ability.id=special_ability_id where (dnd_monstertype.name="Humanoid" or dnd_monstertype.name="Monstrous Humanoid") and dnd_special_ability.name like "%gaze%";
  Medusa|Petrifying gaze
  Gloom|Fear gaze
  Hebi-no-onna|Hypnotic gaze
  Xtabay|witching gaze
  Blindheim|Gaze

But this misses the sea hag, so we're probably missing others.

  sqlite> select dnd_monster.name,dnd_special_ability.name from dnd_monster inner join dnd_monstertype on dnd_monster.type_id=dnd_monstertype.id inner join monster_special_ability on dnd_monster.id=monster_id inner join dnd_special_ability on dnd_special_ability.id=special_ability_id where (dnd_monstertype.name="Humanoid" or dnd_monstertype.name="Monstrous Humanoid") and (dnd_special_ability.name like "%gaze%" or dnd_special_ability.name like "%eye%" or dnd_special_ability.name like "%appearance%");
